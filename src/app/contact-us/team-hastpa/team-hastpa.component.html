                        Himalayan Adventure Sports & Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA) was initiated by a group of like minded people from varied backgrounds and disciplines in October, 2004.The motivating factor for forming the organization was to promote holistic adventure tourism in the state of Himachal Pradesh, encompassing pertinent issues of sustainable tourism, such as livelihoods, environment conservation, community based tourism etc.
                        <br>
                        The natural resource base of any given area is the most valuable resource for its ecological as well as economical development. In the modern paradigms of development, tourism has become an activity that addresses the issues of community initiatives for sustainable development. Himachal Pradesh with its unique topography and culture is a great attraction to tourists. What also has to be considered in developing a long term tourism sustainability plan is the economic factors which motivate the local communities in taking the necessary steps to promote adventure based tourism in a consistent, phased manner preserving all that which today makes it an important part of the itinerary of the tourist visiting the region.
